              <h5>7 July 2018</h5>  
                
              <br><p><strong>Chapter 3 of 'Search Inside Yourself' - What did you learn from your 'mindfulness conversation'? How did the other person find it?</strong> 
              </p>
              <p>I have actually done this in the past when I was travelling in India, but it was good to do it again. It is obviously disconcerting initially - being (verbally at least) in a one way conversation - but it is actually very good listening practice. Both my partner and I enjoyed it, and we plan to do it again. You really do take in everything that the other person is saying when you are consciously listening, and not thinking about interjecting.</p>
              <br><p>
                <strong> Which of the three suggested techniques will you use to sustain your practice? </strong>
              </p>
              <p>I'm a big believer in the importance of breath. Taking one in the morning, to reassert that you are indeed alive and present, is a very good habit to get into. Ideally I would like to check in with this technique throughout the day - just stopping and focussing on breath - especially when a situation arises that is problematic. Creating a proper habit of checking in on my breathing is something that I want to persist with. Building this habit will lead to better results, and a calmer state of mind! </p>
