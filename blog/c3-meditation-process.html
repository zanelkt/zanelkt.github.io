              <h5>3 July 2018</h5>  
                
              <br><p><strong>How did the 'process over product' concept affect the way you tackled the site redesign and rebuild?</strong> 
              </p>
              <p>It helped me focus on what the overall goal was, or is, at this stage. I found myself spending a lot of time with the little aesthetic things like font/background colour and padding size, but I had to remind myself that the main purpose at the moment is to create a website that functions well. The code, test, redo approach can be useful in terms of just understanding what exactly an element does, and how it can be manipulated.</p>
              <br><p>
                <strong>What did you think about meditation before reading chapter 2?</strong>
              </p>
              <p>I think meditation is a very important, although misunderstood and undervalued, part of life. Personally, I don't do it often enough. But I do also believe in finding something to do, that works for you, that can relax your mind - be it gardening or having a walk in a park or, in my case, running and playing guitar.</p>
              <br><p>
               <strong> What new things have you learnt about meditation? </strong>
              </p>
              <p>Following your breath and focusing on it is a very important concept. Breathing as if your life depends on it is a very good mantra to have at the forefront of your mind. I do find myself getting distracted by other things and thoughts when meditating, but focussing on the breath really brings everything back to centre.</p>
              <br><p>
                <strong>Did any of the suggested meditation techniques stand out to you?</strong>
              </p>
              <p>The grandmother mind - adopting the mind of a loving grandmother - is a great concept. We need to be gentle with ourselves, and the more we adopt this technique ( and meditation in general ) the more of a habit it becomes. </p>
