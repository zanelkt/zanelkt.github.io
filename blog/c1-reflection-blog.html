    <p><strong>What's your take on the DBC/EDA experience?</strong> </p> 
    <p>DBC and EDA appear to take a more holistic and practical approach to academia, compared to traditional institutions. Intensive, communal, hands on study is a big part of their motto, rather than the more theoretical and individualistic approach taken by traditional institutions.

      <strong>Have your expectations of EDA changed? If so, how? </strong>
