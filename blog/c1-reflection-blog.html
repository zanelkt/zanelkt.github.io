      What's your take on the DBC/EDA experience? DBC and EDA appear to take a more holistic and practical approach to academia, compared to traditional institutions. Intensive, communal, hands on study is a big part of their motto, rather than the more theoretical and individualistic approach taken by traditional institutions.

      What are your impressions? I have only positive impressions so far, and I'm sure these impressions will refine and enhance as I go along and my knowledge increases.

      How do you see yourself engaging with this type of culture? I will be fine with it. It's new to me, but I think it will be refreshing.

      Have your expectations of EDA changed? If so, how? No. The bottom line is that it will take a lot of hard work and commitment to succeed.
