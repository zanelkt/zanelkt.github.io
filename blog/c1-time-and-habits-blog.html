    <p><strong>Which timebox and habits techniques did you try?</strong> 
    </p>
    <p>Meditation and the Pomodoro technique.</p>
    <p>
      <strong>What did you find interesting? </strong>
    </p>
    <p>Finding time to settle my brain enhanced my productivity when I began working again.</p>
    <p>
     <strong> What worked for you? </strong>
    </p>
    <p>I like the idea that giving yourself a short break after intensive study or work feels like a reward for your efforts. I will continue to do this going forward.</p>
    <p>
      <strong>Which will you experiment further with? </strong>
    </p>
    <p>Meditiation is huge in life I believe. I can find calmness through playing guitar, but I would like to try just sitting still more. The Fogg Method is interesting also.</p>
