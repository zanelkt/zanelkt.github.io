    <p>
      What did you find interesting? Finding time to settle my brain enhanced my productivity when I began working again.

    <p>
      What worked for you? I like the idea that giving yourself a short break after intensive study or work feels like a reward for your efforts. I will continue to do this going forward.

    <p>
      Which will you experiment further with? Meditiation is huge in life I believe. I can find calmness through playing guitar, but I would like to try just sitting still more. The Fogg Method is interesting also.
