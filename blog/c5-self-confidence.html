              <h5>13 July 2018</h5>  
                
              <br><p><strong> Chapter Four of "Search Inside Yourself" - What is the relationship between mindfulness and self awareness?</strong> 
              </p>
              <p>Both of these concepts are essentially the same. They can mutually assist each other. They relate to being in the moment - where we are consciously aware of our emotional and physical being. </p>
              <p>Body Scanning and Journaling exercises can enhance and better their development within oneself. Not being distracted or affected by outside influences are crucial to these concepts also. </p>
              <br><p>
                <strong> Try at least one of the self awareness practices from the chapter (Body Scan, Journaling). What was your experience of it? How did you feel?</strong>
              </p>
              <p>I tried the Body Scan practice, which I have done previously in yoga. It is interesting to focus your mind on a particular part of the body at a given time. It helped me lock into my meditative mind, and I also found that my breathing was more smooth and consistent.</p>
              <br><p>
               <strong> What did you take away from the "My Emotions are Not Me" section? </strong>
              </p>
              <p>Emotions are not us - we don't become them we just simply feel them. They pass, like clouds in the sky. This is an important lesson to learn in life, because it can be easy to get overwhelmed at times.
