    <p><strong>What is grid based design?</strong> </p>
    <p>Grid based design is a way to structure the contents of a web page. The page is divided into columns and rows, the sizes of which can be altered as desired. This type of layout improves the visual experience of the user visiting the page.

    <p><strong>Whats all the hype about responsive webpages?</strong>
    </p>
    <p>In todays technological world, there are many types of devices to choose from. These all have different types of screen sizes and resolutions. A responsive web page takes this into consideration, so that the content on the page remains attractive and uncluttered to the users' eyes, on each and any type of device. The win-width property in CSS can be used for this.</p>
    
    <p><strong>What is semantic structure?</strong></p>
    <p>Semantic HTML is HTML that introduces meaning and provides more depth of understanding to the web page. Semantic tags make it clear to the browser what the meaning of a page and its content is. Examples of this: < strong > ; < h1 > ; < var > .
    </p>

    <p><strong>Any other points you found interesting and want to reflect on?</strong></p>
    <p>Something I am beginning to realise is that web design is mathematical and structured, as well as creative. I like this aspect of it, as it engages both sides of the brain. It's good to know that when something is coded correctly, it will do exactly what you want! And vice versa.
