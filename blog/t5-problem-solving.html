              <h5>13 July 2018</h5>  
                
              <br><p><strong>Tell your non-tech friend about a time you got blocked on a simple problem and solved it in an elegant way.</strong> 
              </p>
              <p>As a coder who is still learning the fundamentals, I found the Free Code Camp Basic JavaScript questions rather challenging at times. I spent a lot of time on the questions, days in fact. There must have been close to 100. I can't recall a specific problem that I had now, but I did have to use certain tools to solve certain problems. Often, taking a break and focussing on my breathing helped my focus and concentration. In the end, if you get really stuck, google is definitely your friend. There is a wealth of knowledge and help online, and it would be silly not to make use of it. I'm not sure if getting help from google is an 'elegant' way of solving a problem, but the knowledge attained can certaintly lead to more elegant problem solving in the future!    </p>
              <br><p>
                <strong>Reflect on how confident you feel using these problem solving processes and techniques: </strong>
              </p>
              <p>Pseudocode - I haven't actually used this technique yet. I do know of it though, and understand that it can be a good way of brainstorming the code before it actually gets written.</p>
              <p>Trying Something - This is something I do quite a lot of. There is no harm in trying something. Trial and Error. If it doesn't work, you go back to the drawing board. 
              <p>Rubber Ducky Method - I haven't tried this one yet, but am aware of it.</p>
              <p>Reading Error Messages - I'm getting much better at reading error messages. The Free Code Camp JavaScript tutorials definitely helped me with this. Just realising what part of the code is incorrect and needs work. </p>  
              <p>Console Logging - I haven't used this technique yet.</p> 
              <p>Googling - Google is a great resource. There are mountains of ideas online, and great help if you know how to find it. I've become adept at googling my code queries. I like it when I don't find the actual answer, but just get a hint. Most sites have a spoiler alert ethic, which is good. Sometimes finding the answer can be helpful anyway, especially when you take the time to understand what the code is doing. </p> 
              <p>Asking Peers For Help - I haven't really reached out on Slack yet. There are lots of 'peers' on google I guess. I will see how the coming sprints go to ascertain whether reaching out on Slack will be necessary. I realise it could be really helpful.</p>  
              <p>Asking Coaches For Help - I have reached out to Kelly quite a few times now (sorry Kelly!). She has always been very helpful.</p>
              <p>Improving Your Process w/ Reflection - Reflecting has definitely helped me. The code, and the process, then sinks in more. Often a short meditative break before reflecting on the code is the best way to go for me. </p>
