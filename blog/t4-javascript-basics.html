              <h5>6 July 2018</h5>  
                
              <br><p><strong>How does JavaScript compare to HTML and CSS?</strong> 
              </p>
              <p>To me, it seems like HTML is the core structure of a website. CSS adds more colour and aesthetically pleasing functions. JavaScript is a further expansion of that, and adds interactivity while allowing the storage of data. It tells the browser how to change the web page in response to events that happen.</p>
              <br><p>
                <strong>Explain control flow and loops using an example process from everyday life, for example 'waking up' or 'brushing your teeth'.</strong>
              </p>
              <p>Code is read and executed from top down, so if the order of your code is not correct it can return different values. Control flow refers to this - the structure that code is written in. All the while, control flow checks to see if the condition is true or false, and then executes a certain code based on the boolean result. Looping is a sequence of instruction.</p>
              <p>An everyday example: The simple act of taking a walk. You know how to move your left leg. You know how to move your right leg. Now do that repeatedly (via a loop) until you arrive at your destination.</p>
              <br><p>
               <strong> Explain the difference between accessing data from arrays and objects. </strong>
              </p>
              <p>In JavaScript, arrays are objects, just slightly modified (with a few more functions). Arrays are for numerically indexed data - for non-numeric keys, we use an Object.</p>
              <br><p>
                <strong>Explain what functions are and why they are useful. </strong>
              </p>
              <p>Functions are a set of code that can be called upon and used repeatedly. Instead of painstakingly writing the same or similar code over and over again, we can simply call a function by its name, then the computer takes over and does the repeating job.</p>
