    <p><strong>Can you think of an analogy to describe HTML, CSS and the DOM? How would you describe it to your non-technical friend?</strong> </p>
    <p>HTML, CSS and the DOM can be analogised to a house. HTML is the structure of a house - where the walls and rooms etc will be. CSS is the style of the house - what colour, size, etc, the house components should be. The DOM is like an architectural building plan which shows each components' details.

    <p><strong>What is meant by boxifying design?</strong>
    </p>
    <p> A 'boxifying design' is a grid of organised boxes that contain various parts of a webpage, such as an image and/or text. Every element on a web page is contained and structured within a box</p>
    <p>
      <strong>What is the box model?</strong>
    </p>
    <p>The CSS box model is the foundation of 'layout' on the internet. Each element is a rectangular box, with the box's content, padding, border, and margin built up around one another. </p>
