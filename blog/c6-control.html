              <br><p><strong>Chapter 5 "Search Inside Yourself" - When programming, what are some of your triggers? What causes a disproportionate emotional response? </strong> 
              </p>
              <p>I definitely have experienced some negative emotions since starting phase zero of Dev Academy. It has usually come about through not understanding the code and what it is doing, or trying to do. When you are studying on your own, without the traditional framework of a classroom and teacher, it can be quite a struggle at times. Even now, I have concerns that I may not be understanding everything as I should, and bootcamp is getting close! I am hoping things sink in more over the next three weeks. I have faith in myself that I can start to thrive once I'm in the bootcamp environment, and understand the concepts more deeply. </p>
              <br><p>
                <strong>How did you find the Siberian North Railroad exercise (Stop, Breathe, Notice, Reflect, Respond)? </strong>
              </p>
              <p>Stopping allows me to acknowledge that I am experiencing a negative emotion, and makes me halt from feeding the monster. Breathing helps me a lot to calm myself and let go. Reflecting on my own reaction from another person's perspective is interesting - it stops me from reacting, and helps me respond and deal with the negative emotion more thoughtfully. </p>
              <p>This exercise is very useful, and I find that it sits well with my personality, as well as my learning techniques. </p>
