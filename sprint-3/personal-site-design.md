What is you site's primary purpose?

My main goal is to build a site tht functions well, and to just continue learning as I go. I am a fan of minimalism.

Who is your target audience?

Myself at this stage. Growing my knowledge and then communicating that knowledge through the design process, to family and friends initially.

How do you want site visitors to interact with your site? What experience would you like them to have?

I would like them to have the least complicated experience possible. Too much clutter is not good.

How will you build your site to support your desired user experience?

I'm not entirely sure yet! It seems a little bit daunting at this stage.
